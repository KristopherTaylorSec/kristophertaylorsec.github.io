## 🧭 About This Site

This is my **technical portfolio and personal proving ground** — a space where I document real-world projects, builds, and experiments.  
Each section reflects active, hands-on work in security engineering, cloud infrastructure, automation, and emerging technology.

I believe in **learning by doing**. Every project here is part of my commitment to grow, refine, and strengthen my craft through consistent practice.
