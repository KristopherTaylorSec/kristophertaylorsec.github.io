### Building secure, efficient, and scalable systems — one project at a time.

This site is my **technical portfolio and proving ground**, where I document hands-on projects, cloud builds, and security engineering work.  
I believe in learning by doing — every project here is part of my commitment to keep improving through hands-on practice.
